Exercises
=========

It is often useful to work through some examples in order to understand how a module works; on this page, there are several exercises of varying difficulty that you can use to learn how to use ``dateutil``.

If you are interested in helping improve the documentation of ``dateutil``, it is recommended that you attempt to complete these exercises with no resources *other than dateutil's documentation*. If you find that the documentation is not clear enough to allow you to complete these exercises, open an issue on the `dateutil issue tracker <https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil/issues>`_ to let the developers know what part of the documentation needs improvement.
